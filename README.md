Hi there 👋

I’m Maaz, a backend developer mainly focused on Laravel and PHP ecosystem. Over the past 2.5+ years, I’ve been building backend systems where real business logic lives from designing scalable REST APIs to handling complex third-party integrations. I enjoy turning messy requirements into structured, maintainable backend architectures.

I’ve worked extensively with payment gateway integrations, Google Maps services, IMAP-based email processing, FedEx shipping APIs, and Microsoft Outlook integrations. Writing clean backend logic, structuring applications with proper design patterns, and keeping code maintainable is something I genuinely care about. Laravel is my strongest framework, but I’ve also worked with CodeIgniter, Symfony and OpenCart, which helped me understand different architectural styles inside the PHP ecosystem.

I’m particularly interested in building systems that are reliable, scalable, and well-structured under the hood, the kind of backend that quietly does its job perfectly.
